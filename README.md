# Gun-Violence-Incidents-US-2013-2018
Gun Violence has been an ongoing issue in the US for a long time now. In this analysis we will explore a number of data that relates to the number of guns related incidents in the U.S. The variables we will be using for this analysis will include: Number of guns involved, number of deaths, number of injured, total number of losses (deaths and injured), state the incidents occur, and months the incidents occur. 
# Objective
My objective is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to data in order to answer the following questions:
1. Where are gun-related incidents more common?
2. How often do these gun-related incidents occur?
3. Does does the number of guns involved affect the total loss?
# Data
We were provided with a dataset that contained incidents data:
  * number_guns_involved
  * participant_status
  * state
  * number_injured
  * number_killed
  * latitude
  * longitude
# Folders
The analysis was seperated into five folders:
  * Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
  * Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original dataframes and the dataframes after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. NOTE: This folder has not been included
  * Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
  * Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
  * Sent to client: The Final Tableau Storyboard
